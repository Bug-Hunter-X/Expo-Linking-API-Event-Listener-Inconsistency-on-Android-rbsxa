To reliably handle deep links, even when the app is closed or in the background, consider using the following workaround:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUrl = async () => {
      const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
      setInitialUrl(url);
    };

    handleUrl();
    const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
      setInitialUrl(event.url);
    });

    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialUrl) {
      // Process the deep link
      console.log('Deep link received:', initialUrl);
    }
  }, [initialUrl]);

  return (
    // ... your app content
  );
}
```

This approach first checks for a deep link received while the app was closed using `Linking.getInitialURL`. Then, it uses `Linking.addEventListener` to catch incoming URLs while the app is running.  This combination ensures better reliability across different app states and Android versions. Remember to properly configure your Android manifest for handling deep links.
