This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` function is not consistently triggered when the app is in the background or killed.  Specifically, if a user taps a deep link while the app is not running, the event listener might not fire, preventing the app from handling the link properly. This inconsistency seems to be more prevalent on Android.
